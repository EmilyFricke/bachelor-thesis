### Introduction

Strictly speaking, the name “Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)” is inappropriate. The
theory was introduced by Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz in his 1952 paper “Portfolio
Selection”, which is now 65 years old and therefore everything else but modern.
Nevertheless, MPT is even today the most widely accepted framework for asset allocation
and a cornerstone of modern finance.

Modern Portfolio Theory was the first mathematical formalization of the idea of diversification,
which allows investors to reduce portfolio risk without sacrificing expected
return. This is often referred to as “only free lunch in investing”. To achieve
diversification, the MPT framework uses Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) that
creates portfolios by choosing a mix of assets that maximizes the expected portfolio
return for a given risk level, where risk is defined as variance.

Since 1952, others have built on the ground-breaking work of Markowitz, beginning
with Bill Sharpe, who introduced the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and
"beta" as a measure of sensitivity to market risk. Eugene Fama and Kenneth French
advanced this model further by the introduction of additional explanatory factors
for the return of an asset. Over time, Markowitz’s ideas built the foundation for the
asset allocation models that are mostly used today.

Despite the theoretical importance of MTP critics started to question the underlying
assumptions of the model. Plentiful empirical studies1 have shown that required
assumptions underlying the Markowitz approach cannot be met in practice. As a result,
MPT has fundamental shortcomings, which lead to improper asset allocations
and incorrect risk assessment.

MPT needed to evolve further to reflect market realities and be "modern" again.
Over the years several approaches aiming to overcome the limitations of the model
have been studied in literature. Those approaches just recently gained increased
importance with the emerge of robo-advisors, automated investment platforms providing
investment advice, that mainly rely on MPT as asset- allocation framework.
Motivated by the rising popularity of robo-advisors and therefore the increasing
importance of its underlying asset- allocation framework, this bachelor thesis will
study and compare different enhancements of the traditional MPT used in the roboadvisor
industry.

The remainder of the thesis is structured as follows.

+ *Chapter 2* presents an overview of the core concepts of Modern Portfolio Theory, discusses its benefits and limitations as well as potential techniques how to overcome those and concludes that Modern Portfolio Theory is even today a compelling framework for asset allocation.

+ *Chapter 3* describes the basic functioning of robo-advisors and discusses the rational for using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which is the investment strategy that most robo-advisors have adopted. It then describes robo-advisors’ general asset allocation methodology, showing that robo-advisors perform a asset allocation based on a modernized MPT framework.

+ *Chapter 4* backtests selected modernization approaches used in the robo-advisor industry such as constraining asset weights, substituting variance with four different downside risk-measurements and forecasting returns with the Black-Litterman model.

+ *Chapter 5* concludes the thesis by emphasizing important findings and providing an outlook for further research of this topic.

Work in progress.

At least I understood how to format nice things like *this* or **that** and very import: inline `code` !
